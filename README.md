# Skyline-AGI-5.1Mv3

Skyline-AGI-5.1Mv3 is a project aimed at advancing Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). This repository includes multiple Python scripts, each contributing to core functionalities such as model optimization, process monitoring, and reinforcement learning. Below is an overview of each file:

## **File Descriptions**

1. **`main.py`**  
   - **Purpose:** Entry point of the application.
   - **Functionality:** Coordinates the execution of primary tasks, initialization of modules, and overall control flow.

2. **`internal_process_monitor.py`**  
   - **Purpose:** Tracks system performance metrics.  
   - **Functionality:** Uses libraries like `psutil` to monitor CPU and memory usage, task queue lengths, and model training/inference times【48】.

3. **`optimization.py`**  
   - **Purpose:** Handles Bayesian optimization of hyperparameters.  
   - **Functionality:** Implements `BayesSearchCV` and parallel optimization methods for tuning models and improving efficiency【49】.

4. **`knowledge_base.py`**  
   - **Purpose:** Manages AGI's knowledge base.  
   - **Functionality:** Performs CRUD operations for storing, retrieving, and updating knowledge in structured formats.

5. **`reinforcement_memory.py`**  
   - **Purpose:** Implements reverse reinforcement mechanisms.  
   - **Functionality:** Applies techniques like Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC) and Experience Replay to enhance memory retention.

6. **`task_manager.py`**  
   - **Purpose:** Orchestrates the execution of multiple tasks.  
   - **Functionality:** Provides task scheduling, prioritization, and management features.

7. **`model_validator.py`**  
   - **Purpose:** Validates model accuracy and performance.  
   - **Functionality:** Contains test cases and metrics to ensure that models meet the expected standards.

8. **`utils.py`**  
   - **Purpose:** Provides utility functions used across the project.  
   - **Functionality:** Includes common operations like file handling, logging, and data preprocessing.

9. **`config.json`**  
   - **Purpose:** Central configuration file.  
   - **Functionality:** Stores adjustable parameters for model training, optimization, and system behavior.

10. **`requirements.txt`**  
    - **Purpose:** Lists project dependencies.  
    - **Functionality:** Ensures consistent setup of the Python environment using `pip`.

11. **`README.md`**  
    - **Purpose:** Documentation for the repository.  
    - **Functionality:** Provides an overview, installation guide, and usage instructions for contributors.
